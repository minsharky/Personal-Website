            <p>Hello! My name is Minseo Kim and I like to build cool things that people can use and enjoy. I am a student at 
              Northwestern University studying Computer Science and Psychology working to be a Software Engineer. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As a CS and Psych double major, I love looking at the intersection of how people interact with tech and vice-versa. 
            Being able to then utilize those observations in order to create tools and platforms that can shape the way 
            people see, use, and appreciate tech is an incredible feat I wish to be a part of.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have helped create numerous projects such a 2D top-down shooter video game called Project Lambda and an online board game platform web application.
            More recently, I've been using the Unity game engine to build my own games as well as look into the ways I can express myself using front-end development.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I am not working, I love to exercise my creative energy through music, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and playing cool video games.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am proficient in JavaScript, Java, C, C++, and C#. I also have experience using Python, HTML, CSS, React.js, Git, Unity, and LaTex.

                  <p>This game was created by Minseo Kim, Akash Deo, and David Park for CS 377 Game Developtment Studio. 
                    We created a 2D top-down shooter and bullet hell game in the Unity Game Engine using C# from scratch in 10 weeks.
                    We designed and incorporated 4 levels, real-time enemy search algorithms, hitbox coroutines, interactive
                    GUI, movement/upgrade controls, various sprites, and music to create cohesive cyberpunk-analog
                    aesthetic as per a formal MDA framework. Over the 10 weeks of developtment, we had biweekly playtesting with 56 regular play testers.

                  <p>This project was made as an assignment for my CS 376 Game Design and Development class. 
                    I used the Unity Game Engine and C# for the game scripts, coding player movement, enemy movement,
                    and other various player mechanics such as the power-up pellets. I also designed the scene using Unity
                    tools in the game engine.
