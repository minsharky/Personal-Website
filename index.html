            <p>Hello! My name is Minseo Kim and I like to build cool things that people can use and enjoy. Currently, I am a student at 
              Northwestern University studying Computer Science and Psychology as well as an aspiring Software Engineer.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a CS and Psych double major, I love looking at the intersection of how people interact with tech and vice-versa. 
            Being able to then utilize those observations in order to create tools and platforms that can shape the way 
            people see, use, and appreciate tech is an incredible feat I wish to be a part of.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have helped create numerous projects such as an online board game platform web application and 
            a handful of recreated retro games such as Tetris, PacMan, and Minesweeper. More recently, I've been using the Unity
            game engine to build my own 2D and 3D games and am excited to share them with you all.
            <br>
            <br>
            When I am not working, I love to exercise my creative energy through music and playing cool video games.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am proficient in JavaScript, Java, C, C++, and C#. I also have experience using HTML, CSS, React.js, Git, Unity, and LaTex.
